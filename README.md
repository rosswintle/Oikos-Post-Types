Oikos-Post-Types
================

A couple of classes that I use that makes working with multiple WordPress custom post types easier.

This should probably, one day, be made into a plugin. But for now, it's just a little PHP library that you can use in your themes and plugins (wherever you're defining post types).

Read the comments at the top of the PHP file for useage and examples.

Hope it's of use to someone!
